<div class="set1">
<p class="question">What kind of website do you want to make for your final project? (Describe the finished project in detail)</p>
<p class="answer">2 website ideas:<br><br>
"what's in my bag"꒰ ˶• ༝ - ˶꒱❀⊹˚. ♡.𖥔 ݁ ˖<br>
User puts items in a bag/takes items out of a bag. Everyday items turn into more absurd objects as you go. With each item there's a short description/caption to act as poetic writing. This shows random objects that accumulate in a person's bag, as well as a catalouging of personal things.<br><br>
"dress up game"ଘ(੭ˊᵕˋ)੭* ੈ✩‧₊˚<br>
A website that references old online games for girls. This would be another way to catalogue items, my closet, and be a continuation of a book I made that was a paper doll fashion book of my clothes. Continue the study of "girly nolstaglic" things. <br><br>
Both of these ideas would be done in a stylized way. Such as taking photos of the objects/clothes and using pngs, or using pixel art, or scaning printed risographs of the images or illustrations.

<div class="set2">
<p class="question">Why do you want to make this project? (for example, you want a portfolio website for applying to things, or…you want to use this project as an opportunity to learn a new skill, or…you want a new work in your portfolio that shows off you skills as a web developer/designer/artist).</p>
<p class="answer">I want to make something that is interactive and reactive, and this would be a good opprotunity to try out ideas I've had for projects. Such as using pngs, pixel illustration, or risograph images to make the website. I also want to contiue my study of "girly" things such as fashion, beauty, and makeup, and how those things have become very personal to me.</p>
</div>
<div class="set3">
<p class="question">What challenges (technical, conceptual, design, etc.) do you anticipate encountering in this project? To put that another way, what do you think you'll struggle with the most with this project?</p>
<p class="answer">Figuring out the code and interactive elements that I want.</p>
